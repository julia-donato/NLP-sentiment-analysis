      "Review: Item is of good quality. Looks great, too. But it does not fit 100's! But it can be stretched to fit them if you carefully push bottom of case with your fingers. Then shove in a pack of 100's(max) and level it out as you close case stretching case closed. Leave a pk.in it for month or so & was la! Buxton is usually a good quality product!\n",

      "Review: I had used my last el-cheapo fake leather cigarette case for SEVEN YEARS. It still closed completely but the plastic made to look like leather was literally falling off, so it was time for a new one. Cigarette cases for kings size cigs are not easy to come by these days I discovered, but I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon. It was a great price, REAL LEATHER, and even had the cool zipper pouch on the back. I was so excited to get my case and toss that other one! Well, within THREE DAYS one of the gold clasps literally broke off! I couldn't believe it! I tried to super glue it back on and was not successful. so, I still use the case but it doesn't close securely. I was very disappointed that my $3.00 plastic one lasted 7 years and this real nice leather one lasted 3 days!! But I still love the zipper pouch on the back, it's great for the spare key to my car because I will not go ANYWHERE without my cigarettes!\n",

Hmmm...didn't quite understand this, but what are you going to do?!  Beware...as I think that had I gone to the Buxton web site I may have been able to obtain the same product for the sugg retail price.\n",

      "Review: Lining in lighter pocket tore within a very short time, had to dab a little contact adhesive between lining and leather to hold it in place and stop it bunching and snagging lighter. Purchased one black one brown, black one used most and has no centre seam down front lighter or rear coin pockets. Brown one has (pointless) decorative centre seam (as usually illustrated) front and rear. Front seam stitching has no reinforcing at lighter pocket opening. Looks likely to give trouble sooner rather than later. Leather is good and solid. Size is spot on for regular (84mm) packs of 20 (after a little use). O.k., But not the \"premium product\" I used to associate with the Buxton name many years ago.\n",

      "Review: I had been looking for a replacement for a cigarette case I'd had for over 25 years and lost. After reviewing several I settled on this one. It was very well made, the leather was soft, not stiff or cheap looking. I loved the little front pocket that kept my lighter handy and easy to keep up with. There is even a small zippered pocket for change or whatever else. I was very pleased with it. Unfortunately, I had not read the description well enough and I discovered this case DOES NOT fit the 100's. It was such a nice case that I gave it to my daughter rather than return it. She has been more than pleased with it. I'm hoping the new one I have ordered is as nice.\n",
